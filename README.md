# hello-world
This is my first repository.
Trying out the editing thing.
I am new to git and would like to start trying out group projects. I figured this would be the best way to get into that.
C# is my favorite language (and the one I work in most). My most recent project is a text editor in c# I might end up putting on here if I find some people interested in making it a group project. I am also planning on getting into c# .NET core web application with razor pages (which I am planning on making my first actual repository). I look forward to learning how to use github and I hope it will help me grow as a programmer and provide opportunities to work with others.
